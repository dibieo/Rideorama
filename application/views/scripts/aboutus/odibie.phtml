            <h4>Ogheneovo (Ovo) Dibie</h4>
            <span>Co-founder &amp; CTO</span>
            <p>As a loyal fan of  Manchester City FC and soccer aficionado, Ovo feels everything including the way we travel should be as beautiful as the beautiful game. <br></br>Â He cringes at the huge environmental foot print of single passenger vehicles criss-crossing mother earth and believes we can reduce this impact one ride share at a time. If Ovo ever made it to American Idol, I'm sure 'Save an ozone ride with someone' would be his special number. Ovo is currently a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>
