     ﻿<br></br>THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES THE PRIVACY POLICY ON WHICH RIDEORAMA, LLC OFFERS YOU ACCESS TO OUR SITE AND SERVICES.
<br></br>Welcome to a Web site operated by Rideorama, LLC. (hereafter referred to as "Rideorama," "we," "us," or "our"). Rideorama, LLC maintains www.rideorama.com (hereafter "Site"), as a service to our users and visitors (our Site and such services, collectively, our "Services").
<br></br>Rideorama provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of this Site. This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through this Site. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service (http://www.rideorama.com/terms). 
<br></br>Please be aware that all confidential credit card information required by the site is processed by PayPal.com. For more information on PayPal’s security policies, please visit the service's website.
<br></br>International Transfer
<br></br>YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO - AND MAINTAINED ON - COMPUTERS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF YOUR STATE, PROVINCE, COUNTRY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL JURISDICTION WHERE THE PRIVACY LAWS MAY NOT BE AS PROTECTIVE AS THOSE IN YOUR JURISDICTION. IF YOU ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND CHOOSE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO US, RIDEORAMA TRANSFERS PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES AND PROCESSES IT THERE. YOUR CONSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY FOLLOWED BY YOUR SUBMISSION OF SUCH INFORMATION REPRESENTS YOUR AGREEMENT TO THAT TRANSFER.
<br></br>Policy Towards Children
<br></br>This Site is not directed to children under 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at team@rideorama.com. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.
<br></br>Personally Identifiable Information
<br></br>When you register with us through the Site and become an Rideorama Member, when you choose to post or request a ride, or when you wish to contact an Rideorama Member, we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Information"). Identity Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, email address and home postal address, but does not include your credit card number or billing information. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries.
<br></br>We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your profile webpage (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences or demographic information) ("Non-Identifying Information").
<br></br>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.
<br></br>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your demographic information). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Rideorama Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Site and Service are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.
<br></br>We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Rideorama newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you.  If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. Please note that we may also use your Personal Information to contact you with information related to your use of the Service; you may not opt out of these notifications.
<br></br>This site contains links to other Web sites. Rideorama.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. From time to time, Rideorama members will have the opportunity to participate in special programs and will be able to opt in to programs that will transfer their information to other services. This will occur only with prior permission from the User. Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services.
<br></br>Rideorama.com expressly disclaims any liability that may arise from the provision of any User of any information whatsoever to this site. You, the User, do hereby agree to hold rideorama.com harmless from any liability that may arise from the provision of any information to this site. By using this site, you also represent and warrant that you have read, understand and agree to the terms stated in the Terms of use which is incorporated herein by reference. Pursuant to the Terms of use, you agree that all information provided to Rideorama.com shall become the property of Rideorama.com subject to any exclusions so stated herein.
<br></br>Security
<br></br>This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. This includes a customer record manager and technical systems. Other than as set forth in this Privacy policy, Rideorama.com does not collect user's personal information. All confidential User information submitted on Rideorama.com's site is processed by PayPal.com.
<br></br>Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" greatly concern Rideorama. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov.
<br></br>Your Rideorama.com Profile is password-protected so that only you and authorized Rideorama.com employees have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone. If you share a computer, you should sign out of your Rideorama.com account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will help protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties.
<br></br>Rideorama makes every effort to ensure that your information is secure on its system. Only certain authorized Rideorama employees can access this information, and then only if it is relevant to their job duties.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, Rideorama.com cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. If you have any further questions on this issue, refer to the site Terms of Use. Rideorama expressly disclaims any liability that may arise should any other individuals obtain the information you submit to this site.
<br></br>Log Data
<br></br>When you visit the Site, whether as an Rideorama Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, an "Rideorama User"), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site's technical administration, to increase our Site's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.  
<br></br>Cookies
<br></br>Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we use persistent cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Site. Second, we use session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by Rideorama Users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and Service and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser.  If you choose to not accept cookies, you cannot participate as a registered, signed-in member.
<br></br>You should be aware that Rideorama.com's advertisers sometimes use banner ads to give you their own cookies. If you want to understand how and why an advertiser uses cookies, check the company's site for their privacy statement. Rideorama.com is not responsible for any issues that may arise regarding the Privacy Policies of any of its affiliates or advertiser. By using this site, you do hereby agree to hold Rideorama.com harmless from any claims and/or damages that may arise from the policies and/or practices (or lack thereof) of any of its affiliates and/or advertisers.
<br></br>Information Sharing and Disclosure
<br></br>Overview
<br></br>Rideorama is designed to allow Members who can offer a ride to a location ("Drivers") and Members who wish to get a ride to a location ("Passengers") to share information with one another in order to facilitate rideshare. Ride Offers posted by Drivers, ratings and reviews of Drivers and Passengers, and the Profile Information (as defined below) of Drivers and Passengers, are visible to any member of the site. If a Driver and a Passenger enter into a confirmed transaction with one another (the Driver accepts the Passenger's request or the Passenger accepts the Driver's offer, and the Passenger's payment details are collected and processed), then the Passenger and the Driver's Identity Information are shared with each other in order to facilitate the reservation. In no event is a Passenger's Billing Information shared with his or her Driver.
<br></br>Rideorama Members and Users
<br></br>When you register through the Site and submit your Personal Information to create a profile webpage, Rideorama Users will see your first name and last initial ("Required Member Identifiers"). You can choose what other Personal Information you provide as part of your profile ("Other Member Information") (together, your "Profile Information"). We will display your Profile Information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Site, and, with your prior permission, on third party sites. Any information you choose to provide as part of your profile should reflect how much you want other Rideorama Users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage members to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. You can review and revise your profile information at any time.
<br></br>If you post a Ride Offer or Ride Request, we may publish that post anywhere on the Site. If you enter into a confirmed transaction with another Rideorama Member (that is, you request lodging from another Member, the other Member confirms your reservation, and your payment is processed, you will have access to that Member's Identity Information, and that Member will have access to your Identity Information. Note that Members will never have access to your Billing Information.
<br></br>Facebook Connect
<br></br>You can log in to our site using Facebook Connect. This service will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name, email address, and picture to pre-populate your profile. Facebook Connect gives you the option to post information about your activities on this web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.
<br></br>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement
<br></br>Rideorama cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Rideorama or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.
<br></br>Business Transfers
<br></br>Rideorama may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.
